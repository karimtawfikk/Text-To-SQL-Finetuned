# Text-To-SQL-finetuned

Developed a Streamlit-based web application powered by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B model to convert natural language inputs into SQL queries, accompanied by explanations tailored for non-technical users. The model was fine-tuned on a synthetic text-to-SQL dataset using Unsloth for memory-efficient training and saved in GGUF format for optimized GPU performance.
